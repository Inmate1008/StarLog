StarLog
=======

A Starbound Log to document Planets. The Goal is to have a Database with detailed Information about Recourses, Biomes, Enemies and Settlements.

I try to do this automatically with the logs of my Starbound Server.
As soon as a Player sets foot on a new planet, i try to fetch as much Data from the Logs and Game itself so only description and a Screenshot needs to be added.
